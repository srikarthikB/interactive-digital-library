<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
The Interactive Digital Library is a prototype web application designed to enhance the reading experience of long-form novels and epics.
Many readers find traditional text-heavy books difficult to engage with, especially classical literature.
</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Long novels often feel overwhelming due to their length, complex narratives, and lack of visual or auditory support.
Existing digital libraries focus on preservation and access but do not actively help users engage with the content.
</p>

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>
This project introduces an AI-assisted reading platform that provides visual and audio aids to help readers better understand and engage with books.
The system acts as an enhancement layer rather than a replacement for existing digital archives.
</p>

<h2>Role of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>
AI-generated scene-based visuals and short audio summaries are used as pre-reading aids.
These features help users visualize important moments and grasp key ideas before reading the full text.
</p>

<h2>Ethical and Legal Considerations</h2>
<p>
Full book content is not hosted directly on this platform.
Instead, users are redirected to trusted public digital archives such as Archive.org.
This ensures ethical usage and legal compliance while still improving accessibility and engagement.
</p>

<h2>Future Scope</h2>
<p>
Future enhancements may include real-time AI-generated visuals, chapter-wise audio explanations, and a fully integrated reading interface.
