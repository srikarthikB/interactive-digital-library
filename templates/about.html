            This project does not host or distribute copyrighted books. All full texts are
            accessed through external public platforms such as Archive.org. The AI-generated
            summaries, visuals, and audio content provided here are intended solely as
            educational pre-reading aids under fair use principles.
        </p>
    </div>


    <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Instead of hosting copyrighted books directly, the platform ethically redirects
        users to publicly accessible sources such as Archive.org, while offering AI-powered
        pre-reading aids to improve comprehension and engagement.
    </p>

    <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This project was developed as part of an academic Design Thinking & Innovation
        assignment, focusing on accessibility, ethical content use, and user-centered design.
